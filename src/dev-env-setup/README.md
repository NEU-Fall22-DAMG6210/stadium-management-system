This is dev-env-setup folder. It will have Oracle SQL scripts for creating development environment i.e dev users.

In Oracle by creating a user, we get schema space where that user can create its own schema objects like tables, indexes, procedures etc.

This setup will allow all the team members to have their own sandbox environment(their own schema) to code features.
